Please test

The functionality of the bot is not very big, you can get:
1. HTTP proxies (~300 at a time)
2. SOCKS proxies (~300 at a time)
3. SSL proxies (~100 at a time)
4. HTTP(S) proxies from GitHub (~1500 at a time)

You can also choose proxies of the following countries:

Belize, Cyprus, Spain, Virgin Islands, Denmark, Germany, USA (especially a lot of proxies from USA).

Updates every 15-60 minutes (depending on the list, I use multiple sources).
